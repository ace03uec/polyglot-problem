# Intro

Rust has been around since a long time as part of Mozilla and has been public since 2015. 
While it has been popular for a number of tasks over time, systems programming and low level programming has been it's forte since the beginning. It has been considered as a natural replace for tasks which were suited to 
`C` with guarantees of memory safety which one does not get in the same. The language has also since found it's way into the linux kernel and cloudnative apps for its tiny memory and usage footprint.
